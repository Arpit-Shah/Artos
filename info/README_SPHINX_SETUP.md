#Setup Sphinx

## Install Python
* Install Python 2.7.10 or above (This has pip command provided by default)
* Add Python binary and scripts locations to Windows Environment Variables "Path"
> `C:\Python27\` and `C:\Python27\Scripts\`
> Note : PC reboot may require before it can take affect
* Run `python --version` command and if version is printed then Python setup is correct.

## Install Sphinx ([Sphinx Tutorial](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.7/tutorial.html))
* Install Sphinx by running following command
```
pip install -U sphinx
```
* Run `sphinx-build --version` command and if version is printed then Sphinx is installed correctly

### Configure Sphinx using quickstart wizard ([Sphinx Tutorial](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.7/tutorial.html))
* Run `sphinx-quickstart` command to set up your very first project
> Note : Only do it if you are running sphinx for the first time
> Most of the option during quick start should be left default by pressing enter key.
> Where necessary provide an answer as shown below
> > Please enter a new root path (or just Enter to exit) []: `C:\ASh\Programming\Artos\Sphinx\01.00.0000\`
> > Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]:`n`
> > Name prefix for templates and static dir [\_]:`_`
> > Project name: `Artos`
> > Author name(s): `ASh Shah`
> > Project release []: `01.00.0000`
> > Project language [en]:`en`
> > Source file suffix [.rst]:`.rst`
> > Name of your master document (without suffix) [index]:`index`
> > Do you want to use the epub builder (y/n) [n]: `y`
> > autodoc: automatically insert docstrings from modules (y/n) [n]: `y`
> > doctest: automatically test code snippets in doctest blocks (y/n) [n]: `y`
> > intersphinx: link between Sphinx documentation of different projects (y/n) [n]: `y`
> > todo: write "todo" entries that can be shown or hidden on build (y/n) [n]: `y`
> > coverage: checks for documentation coverage (y/n) [n]: `y`
> > imgmath: include math, rendered as PNG or SVG images (y/n) [n]: `y`
> > mathjax: include math, rendered in the browser by MathJax (y/n) [n]: `y`
> > ifconfig: conditional inclusion of content based on config values (y/n) [n]: `y`
> > viewcode: include links to the source code of documented Python objects (y/n) [n]: `y`
> > githubpages: create .nojekyll file to publish the document on GitHub pages (y/n) [n]: `y`
> > Create Makefile? (y/n) [y]: `y`
> > Create Windows command file? (y/n) [y]: `y`

* At this point some files and directories will be generated by Sphinx tool at location:
> `C:\ASh\Programming\Artos\Sphinx\01.00.0000\`build
> `C:\ASh\Programming\Artos\Sphinx\01.00.0000\`source
> `C:\ASh\Programming\Artos\Sphinx\01.00.0000\`make.bat
> `C:\ASh\Programming\Artos\Sphinx\01.00.0000\`Makefile

### Build First project ([Sphinx Tutorial](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.7/tutorial.html))
* Go to location `C:\ASh\Programming\Artos\Sphinx\01.00.0000\`
* Run command `.\make.bat html` to see output of .rst file to html in _build directory
* Run command `.\make.bat singlehtml` to see output of .rst file to single html in _build directory
OR
* If you move generated files to alternate location `Example : C:\User\test\`, then write own .bat file to execute build with following command.
> `sphinx-build -b html "C:\User\test" "C:\User\test\_build"`
* If you see HTML output inside build directory then Sphinx setup is working and Sphinx is building correctly.

### Install `sphinx_rtd_theme` theme

> `pip install sphinx_rtd_theme`

### Check out ArtosDOC project
([ArtosDOC](https://github.com/Arpit-Shah/ArtosDoc))

* Go to check out location
* Go to docs directory
* launch Command prompt or PowerShell from Windows at that location
* Run following command to make html

> Run command `.\make.bat html`

* User shall see output in build/html directory
* To modify anything sources could be found in source directory

* Run following command to clean html

> Run command `.\make.bat clean`
